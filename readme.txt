How To Play:
Use dashes to hit enemies and chain your way up to the top of the level!
If you hit an enemy while not dashing, you will die. This means you can only touch enemies while dashing.
Furthermore, you only get your jump back if you make contact with an enemy, otherwise you will fall to the bottom.

Controls:
Left click or space: dash
R: Restart Game
L: Restart Level

Cheat Codes
J: Activate unlimited dashes (toggles)
